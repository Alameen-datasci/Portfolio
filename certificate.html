            <h3>Narrative Description</h3>
            <p>More than just a coding course, CS50x was a rigorous deep dive into the art of computational thinking. Starting with the raw power of C, I learned how computers "think" at the hardware level—managing memory and pointers—before scaling up to higher-level abstractions in Python and SQL. This course taught me not to just write code, but to solve complex problems with algorithmic efficiency and elegance.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> Mastered low-level concepts like memory management, pointers, and data structures (Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Tables) in C.</li>
              <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Gained proficiency in searching and sorting algorithms, focusing on time complexity (Big O notation).</li>
              <li><strong>Web Engineering:</strong> Built dynamic web applications using Python (Flask), SQL, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</li>
              <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Developed the resilience to tackle novel engineering challenges without a roadmap.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Narrative Description</h3>
            <p>While CS50x taught me how to solve problems, CS50p taught me how to solve them <em>The Pythonic Way</em>. This specialized course focused on writing code that is not only functional but also readable, robust, and efficient. It refined my ability to use powerful libraries, write unit tests, and leverage Object-Oriented Programming principles to build scalable software.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Advanced Python:</strong> Moved beyond syntax to master Regular Expressions (Regex), File I/O, and Functional Programming.</li>
              <li><strong>Code Quality:</strong> Learned to write robust code using Unit Testing (pytest), exception handling, and style guides (PEP 8).</li>
              <li><strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong> Implemented custom Classes and Objects to model real-world problems.</li>
              <li><strong>APIs & Libraries:</strong> Gained experience interacting with third-party APIs and libraries to extend functionality.</li>

            <h3>Narrative Description</h3>
            <p>This course served as my entry point into the data science ecosystem. I transitioned from general programming to data manipulation, learning to wrangle messy, real-world datasets into clean, actionable insights. It provided a strong command over the Pandas library, allowing me to perform complex statistical analyses and prepare data for machine learning models.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Wrangling:</strong> Mastered Pandas and NumPy for efficient data cleaning, merging, and reshaping.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Learned vectorization techniques to process large datasets faster than standard loops.</li>
              <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Conducted hypothesis testing and statistical analysis on real-world datasets.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Deep understanding of Series and DataFrame objects for handling tabular data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Narrative Description</h3>
            <p>Data is only as powerful as your ability to communicate it. In this course, I learned to bridge the gap between analytics and visual storytelling. Beyond just generating charts, I studied the principles of information design—learning how to avoid misleading visualizations and how to create graphics that are both aesthetically pleasing and statistically accurate.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Visualization Tools:</strong> Advanced proficiency in Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating static and interactive plots.</li>
              <li><strong>Design Principles:</strong> Applied the data-ink ratio and other design rules to create clutter-free, high-impact visuals.</li>
              <li><strong>Statistical Communication:</strong> Learned to visualize uncertainty (error bars, confidence intervals) rather than just simple averages.</li>
              <li><strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong> Used visual techniques to uncover hidden patterns and trends in complex data.</li>
